      oneLiner: "Romanticizing red flags since forever.",
      description: "You live in a world of signs, songs, and soft lighting. Your coping mechanism is romanticizing every red flag and turning breakdowns into character arcs. One missed text and you’re convinced they hate you, but one flirty emoji? Wedding playlist. You vanish mid-crisis, reemerge with a new aesthetic, and call it healing. Honestly, you make unhinged look poetic."

      oneLiner: "You forgive. But not really. But yes. But no",
      description: "You say 'it’s fine' but you’re already writing a 12-part memoir about the betrayal. You never forget, you rarely forgive, and your inner circle is just you and your memory of what people did wrong in 2017. You believe in karma, but only if you’re the one delivering it. Passive-aggression is an art, and your weapon of choice is the vague caption that cuts too deep."

      name: "🧠 Chronic Analyzer",
      oneLiner: "Overthinking is your cardio.",
      description: "Every thought is a think piece. Every text is dissected like it's a sacred manuscript. You’ve got a PhD in overthinking and a minor in spiraling quietly. You self-reflect so hard it loops back into self-sabotage. But don’t worry — at least you’ve got a color-coded plan for your emotional collapse. You haven’t followed it, but you have it. That counts."

      name: "🕳 Emotional Minimalist",
      oneLiner: "Feelings? In this economy?",
      description: "You feel everything — you just don’t show it. Vulnerability makes you sweat. You’ll ghost before you explain, disappear before you decompress, and smile while dying inside. To others, you’re chill. To yourself? Absolute war zone. But repressing emotions is cheaper than therapy, right?"

      name: "💅 Main Character Syndrome",
      oneLiner: "You’re not dramatic. You’re just interesting.",
      description: "The spotlight loves you — and you love it back. You narrate your life like there’s a camera crew nearby, and every mildly dramatic event becomes a personal plot twist. You’re not self-centered, you’re self-aware. The story doesn’t move without you, and if it does, it’s irrelevant. At least you’re hot and emotionally interesting."

      oneLiner: "Your group chat has seen too much.",
      description: "You overshare like it’s a love language. You’ll trauma-dump in a group chat, post a crying selfie with a Lana lyric, and then say “omg ignore me lol.” You’re deeply in touch with your feelings — and everyone else’s inbox. People don’t know whether to hug you or block you, and that’s kind of your power."

      description: "You are the storm and the calm after it. Planning? For what? You make impulsive decisions, start over mid-sentence, and treat your life like a social experiment with no control group. Somehow, it works. Your life may be in shambles, but at least it’s never boring. Honestly, you’re the reason we have plot."
